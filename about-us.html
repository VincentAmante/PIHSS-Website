            <div>
                Established in 1974 Pakistan Islamia Higher Secondary School Sharjah abbreviated as PIHSS has provided quality education to the children of Pakistani Expat Community in Sharjah for more than four decades now. The school has quality staff who can deliver the goods. Curriculum of pre-Board students i.e. from KG to grade 8 has been recently revised to enable our students to participate in International Benchmarking Tests like PISA, PIRLS, ASSET, TIMSS, CAT 4 and IBT. These tests have been set as part of the National Agenda of the UAE for the 21st Century. Whereas the curriculum of the Board Classes from grade 9 to grade 12 is that of the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Islamabad, Pakistan.

In its journey of over 45 years PIHSS has produced alumni both male and female who have made their mark not only back home in Pakistan but also in the UAE and across the globe in almost every field like engineering, medicine, arts, law, management, business and sports. The School is governed by the Administrative Affairs Committee or AAC which comprises of seasoned, highly qualified and wise Pakistani professionals who provide high quality guidance to the management of the school in the light of their rich experience as experts of their fields. Mr. Hamid Abdouli, the Chairman of AAC and sponsor of the school, is a visionary who is fully cognizant of the current and future educational needs of today’s diverse and dynamic world.

The Administrative Affairs Committee (AAC) of the school comprises of highly qualified, seasoned and honourable Pakistani professionals who ensure smooth, transparent and meritorious functioning of the school. Mr. Hamid Abdouli, the Chairman AAC and sponsor of the school, is very keen for further uplift of school and make it one of the leading centres of education in the UAE.

Keeping in view the transition of the world into the 4th Industrial Revolution and the past rich history of the school I as Principal strongly feel that PIHSS has the potential to become a school of a good or very good ranking. I along with my colleagues and with the blessing of the AAC, therefore, have set the goal of achieving Band A in the next full Six Standard Review by February or March 2022 or whenever that review takes place. I strongly believe that our school CAN achieve this goal by undergoing a sea change of school culture, by adopting the best learning and teaching practices, by incorporating the skills of Emotional Intelligence, promoting the Growth Mind-Set and by establishing the norms of collaborative, supportive mutual and self-improvement of individuals and teams. QUALITY EDUCATION IS A TEAM SPORT. May I invite our alumni and all segments of our Expat Community to join hands with us in making PIHSS as the first Pakistani School earning the Band A ranking. By a fortunate and happy coincidence our School Goal is aligned with the School Improvement Agenda of Sharjah Private School authority, SPEA.

Looking forward to your support and prayers.

Abdul Qudus Saggu

Principal, PIHSS
