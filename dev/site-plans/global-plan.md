# Global Plan

Focuses on global elements (header, footer)

## Header

- 'Modify on scroll' Code Samples:
  - [Sample code of changing style on scroll](https://codepen.io/DylanMacnab/pen/KVgGbK/)
  - [Another way of doing it](https://codepen.io/expressivemedia/pen/ORGqvq)
  - [Hide on scroll down, show on scroll up](https://codepen.io/oscarpas/pen/oNpLNx)

- Hamburger Code Samples:
  - [Simple version](https://codepen.io/sanketbodke/details/KKyoqyq) - Modifies based on screen size
  - [Highly Animated Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/krishandeep/pen/oNoXMwE) - Might be overdoing it tbh

## Footer

- Map might be the challenge, ask Nehan/Louis for how they want it
- Ensure the contacts are not built-in (no mailto or contact)
- Everything else should be simple
