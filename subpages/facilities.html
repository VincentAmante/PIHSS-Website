          No educational institution is complete without a good, well stocked
          library, nor can education be complete without inculcating healthy
          reading habits. The school has two well stocked, spacious, well lit
          and ventilated libraries which house about 10,000 books on varied
          subjects. Children have their individual preferences when it comes to
          reading. To ensure that every child gets to read what he likes, the
          school sends group of teachers to Book Fairs to select titles which
          are then added to the libraries after the necessary review of their
          appropriateness. The libraries are managed by qualified librarians.
